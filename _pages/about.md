## About me

I am a Master’s student in Financial Technology at Washington University in St. Louis, with a background in Computer Engineering from The Pennsylvania State University.

My academic and professional interests focus on data analytics, systems development, and machine learning. I am particularly interested in building data-driven systems that combine solid engineering foundations with practical analytical and modeling techniques.

During my undergraduate and graduate studies, I have worked across data engineering, software development, and machine learning. My experience includes analyzing large-scale log and sensor data, building ETL pipelines using Python and SQL, and developing backend services and dashboards for data visualization. I also have hands-on experience with deep learning models, including image super-resolution approaches implemented with PyTorch.

Previously, I worked as a Game Testing Intern at Coconut Island Games, where I analyzed gameplay logs to identify performance bottlenecks and crash patterns, and supported regression and performance testing workflows. I also completed a Software Development Internship at Jiangsu Delauney Information Co., Ltd., where I contributed to automating CAD drawing workflows using C++ and Python-based services integrated with LLM APIs.

I am currently seeking opportunities related to data analytics, machine learning, and software or systems development, where I can apply my technical background to solve real-world problems and continue to grow as an engineer.
